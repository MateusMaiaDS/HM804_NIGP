# Gaussian Process Training with Input Noise
R implementation of the model "Gaussian Process Training with Input Noise" from Andrew McHutchon &amp; Carl Edward Rasmussen (2011)


To reproduce simulation scenarios is only necessary to run the file `modelling_file_HM804.R` with the other files in the same directory. To plot it, just run the file `plotting_noise_gpbart.R` afterward.
